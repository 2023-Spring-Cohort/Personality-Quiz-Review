# Personality-Quiz-C#-Review

#### You are creating a Buzzfeed-style personality quiz. Users should answer some provided questions and then receive feedback as to what their personality best fits. This could be a “Which dog breed are you?” or a “Which DnD class are you?”, there is freedom in that regard. Some guidelines:
- Create categories for your users to fall into
- Create questions for your user to answer, each one multiple choice
- Each answer should be tied to one of the categories, and should award a point to that category if chosen
- After the quiz is over, display which category they fall into the most
### Some things to consider when writing this program:
- Use Classes to house the appropriate data
- Use Collections to store multiple things when possible
- Make it make sense for you! Take your own approach to this
- Have fun!
